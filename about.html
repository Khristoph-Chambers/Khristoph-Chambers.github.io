    <h3 style="color: white;">Internet Exchange Points are places at which local Internet Service Providers exchange Internet traffic 
      between their networks and are critical to the overall health of the Internet. These networks are uniquely described as Autonomous 
      Systems and are identified by autonomous system numbers (ASNs) and IXPs typically require that entities seeking to participate at 
      the IXP possess such a number before joining. </h4><br>

      <div class="col-4">

      A local IXP allows ISPs to connect directly, locally and offers the possibility of exchanging traffic locally at no cost without the 
      need to buy transit from other ISPs that may involve the use of costly foreign exchange. <br><br>The reason for this is that by peering at the 
      IXP, participating ISPs now have the opportunity to be able to deliver local content locally rather than having to deliver this content 
      to their upstream providers and subsequently are able to reduce the average per-bit delivery cost of their service as well as improve 
      their profitability, reinvestment as well as their competiveness.   
    </div>
    <div class="col-4">
      Further the opportunity for local exchange of traffic and routes 
      improves the overall resilience of the fibre network as well as it offers the chance for improved latency for locally hosted content.<br><br>
      The IXP is its simplest sense is a layer 2 physical network switch and is usually operated by a single entity that often administers 
      the IXP on a not-for-profit basis through an association of its participants. The arrangement involves the use of a shared switch fabric 
      where participants typically arrange for peering through bi-lateral agreements for the exchange of traffic and routes through their 
      respective routers.

      <p>The GOJ as part of its policy ICT policy made it a key priority that the nation should have island wide ICT infrastructure that facilitates 
        greater access to high capacity networks with interconnection to international networks. They further went on state that as a part of the 
        strategies to accomplish this was to establish a National Internet Exchange Point in Jamaica.  </p>
       <br>
       <p>In addition to this there were key national initiatives underway, including the establishment of a Jamaican logistics hub, which would be 
        helped by the presence of a local IXP that will be able to handle greater volumes of data that would be generated within the island as a result 
        of these initiatives. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-4">
      <p>With the strategic objectives of the GOJ in mind, the Office of Utilities Regulation (OUR) set about the task of bringing key stakeholders together 
        with the hosting of the Jamaican Internet Exchange Point Symposium in collaboration with the Caribbean Telecommunications Union and Packet Clearing House, 
        the world’s leading implementer of Internet Exchange Points.</p><br>
      <p>The symposium brought together members of academia, Internet Service Providers (ISPs), content houses and other interested parties. From the 
        symposium the OUR, as facilitator of the IXP implementation process, was able to assemble a working group drawn from the gathering to establish the 
        facility and move the process forward.  </p>
